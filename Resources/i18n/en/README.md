## Some Notes

### Remember to Share

Share or soulless.

### About Missing Data

- Check your commit email, although it's auto-configured.
- Verify your git log format. Do not manually modify the time format.
- Check your git version. The tested version is `git version 2.30.1 (Apple Git-130)`.

### About Sandbox

Please be aware that this application does not run inside the sandbox. It has the ability to access all resources in your system. Given the special nature of the data this program processes, we want to clarify a few things:

- Because the program uses the system's built-in git for operations, sandbox cannot be enabled. If you want to enable sandbox, you'll need to embed the git binary yourself.
- This application only analyzes and processes data locally and **will not upload any data**.
- Apple has enhanced protection for sensitive data. Even without sandbox enabled, files in documents, photos, and other directories still receive additional protection. You'll be explicitly asked for authorization when accessing them.
- The application has been uploaded to Apple for harmless notarization. Please check the code signature before running.

### Some Usage Precautions

- If the statistical data seems problematic, check your commit email.
- We **make no guarantees about the completeness or accuracy of the data**.
- **Using tokens to batch-pull repositories might trigger security alerts from your organization. For company repositories, local analysis is recommended.**
- Before sharing analysis results on social networks, **please thoroughly read the report and check if any content involves confidential information**.
